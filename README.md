# Linear-Regression
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a Linear Regression model using Python. The model is trained to make predictions based on a dataset loaded from a .pkl (Pickle) file.

#What’s Inside:
-Loading and preprocessing a dataset from a Pickle file
-Training a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn
-Evaluating the model’s performance
-Making predictions on new data
-Saving and loading the model for reuse
